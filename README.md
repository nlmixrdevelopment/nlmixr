`nlmixr` is an R package for fitting general dynamic models,
pharmacokinetic (PK) models and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD)
models in particular, with either individual data or population
data. The nlme and SAEM estimation routines can be accessed using a
universal user interface (UUI), that provides universal model and
parameter definition syntax and results in a fit object that can be
used as input into the `Xpose` package. Running nlmixr using the UUI
is described in [this vignette](https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/nlmixr/articles/running_nlmixr.html).

Under the hood `nlmixr` has five main modules:  

1. `dynmodel()` and its mcmc cousin `dynmodel.mcmc()` for nonlinear
   dynamic models of individual data;
2. `nlme_lin_cmpt()`for one to three linear compartment models of
   population data with first order absorption, or i.v. bolus, or
   i.v. infusion using the nlme algorithm;
3. `nlme_ode()` for general dynamic models defined by ordinary
   differential equations (ODEs) of population data using the nlme
   algorithm;
4. `saem_fit` for general dynamic models defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of population data by the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization (SAEM) algorithm;  
5. `gnlmm` for generalized non-linear mixed-models (possibly defined
   by ordinary differential equations) of population data by the
   adaptive Gaussian quadrature algorithm.

A few utilities to facilitate population model building are also included in `nlmixr`.

Documentation can be found at https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/nlmixr/, and we maintain a comprehensive and ever-growing guide to using `nlmixr` at our [bookdown site](https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/nlmixr_bookdown/index.html).

More examples and the associated data files are available at 
https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr/tree/master/vignettes.

We recommend you have a look at [`RxODE`](https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/RxODE/articles/RxODE-intro.html), the engine upon which `nlmixr` depends, as well as [`xpose.nlmixr`](https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/xpose.nlmixr), which provides a link to the seminal nonlinear mixed-effects model diagnostics package [`xpose`](https://uupharmacometrics.github.io/xpose/), and [`shinyMixR`](https://github.com/RichardHooijmaijers/shinyMixR), which provides a means to build a project-centric workflow around nlmixr from the R command line and from a streamlined [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) front-end application. Members of the nlmixr team also contribute to the [`ggPMX`](https://github.com/ggPMXdevelopment/ggPMX), [`xgxr`](https://github.com/Novartis/xgxr) and [`pmxTools`](https://github.com/kestrel99/pmxTools) packages. For PKPD modeling (with ODE and dosing history) with
[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/), check out Yuan Xiong's package [`PMXStan`](https://github.com/yxiong1/pmxstan).

## Installation

When on CRAN, you can install the released version of nlmixr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("nlmixr")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr")
```
