\arguments{
\item{object}{nlmixr object}

\item{...}{Other arguments sent to \code{rxSolve}}

\item{params}{a numeric named vector with values for every
parameter in the ODE system; the names must correspond to the
parameter identifiers used in the ODE specification;}

\item{events}{an \code{eventTable} object describing the input
(e.g., doses) to the dynamic system and observation sampling
time points (see \code{\link{eventTable}});}

\item{inits}{a vector of initial values of the state variables
(e.g., amounts in each compartment), and the order in this
vector must be the same as the state variables (e.g., PK/PD
compartments);}

\item{scale}{a numeric named vector with scaling for ode
parameters of the system.  The names must correstond to the
parameter identifiers in the ODE specification. Each of the
ODE variables will be divided by the scaling factor.  For
example \code{scale=c(center=2)} will divide the center ODE
variable by 2.}

\item{method}{The method for solving ODEs.  Currently this supports:

\itemize{
\item \code{"liblsoda"} thread safe lsoda.  This supports parallel
           thread-based solving, and ignores user Jacobian specification.
\item \code{"lsoda"} -- LSODA solver.  Does not support parallel thread-based
      solving, but allows user Jacobian specification.
\item \code{"dop853"} -- DOP853 solver.  Does not support parallel thread-based
        solving nor user Jacobain specification
}}

\item{transitAbs}{boolean indicating if this is a transit
compartment absorption}

\item{atol}{a numeric absolute tolerance (1e-8 by default) used
by the ODE solver to determine if a good solution has been
achieved;  This is also used in the solved linear model to check
if prior doses do not add anything to the solution.}

\item{rtol}{a numeric relative tolerance (1e-6 by default) used
by the ODE solver to determine if a good solution has been
achieved. This is also used in the solved linear model to check
 if prior doses do not add anything to the solution.}

\item{maxsteps}{maximum number of (internally defined) steps allowed
during one call to the solver. (5000 by default)}

\item{hmin}{The minimum absolute step size allowed. The default
value is 0.}

\item{hmax}{The maximum absolute step size allowed.  When
\code{hmax=NA} (default), uses the avearge difference in times
and sampling events. When \code{hmax=NULL} RxODE uses the
maximum difference in times in your sampling and events.  The
value 0 is equivalent to infinite maximum absolute step size.}

\item{hini}{The step size to be attempted on the first step. The
default value is determined by the solver (when hini = 0)}

\item{maxordn}{The maximum order to be allowed for the nonstiff
(Adams) method.  The default is 12.  It can be between 1 and
12.}

\item{maxords}{The maximum order to be allowed for the stiff (BDF)
method.  The default value is 5.  This can be between 1 and 5.}

\item{cores}{Number of cores used in parallel ODE solving.  This
defaults to the number or system cores determined by
\code{\link{rxCores}} for methods that support parallel
solving (ie thread-safe methods like "liblsoda").}

\item{covsInterpolation}{specifies the interpolation method for
    time-varying covariates. When solving ODEs it often samples
    times outside the sampling time specified in \code{events}.
    When this happens, the time varying covariates are
    interpolated.  Currently this can be:

\itemize{
\item \code{"linear"} interpolation (the default), which interpolates the covariate
    by solving the line between the observed covariates and extrapolating the new
    covariate value.
\item \code{"constant"} -- Last observation carried forward.
\item \code{"NOCB"} -- Next Observation Carried Backward.  This is the same method
      that NONMEM uses.
\item \code{"midpoint"} Last observation carried forward to midpoint; Next observation
  carried backward to midpoint.
}}

\item{addCov}{A boolean indicating if covariates should be added
to the output matrix or data frame. By default this is
disabled.}

\item{matrix}{A boolean inticating if a matrix should be returned
instead of the RxODE's solved object.}

\item{sigma}{Named sigma covariance or Cholesky decomposition of a
covariance matrix.  The names of the columns indicate
parameters that are simulated.  These are simulated for every
observation in the solved system.}

\item{sigmaDf}{Degrees of freedom of the sigma t-distribution.  By
default it is equivalent to \code{Inf}, or a normal distribution.}

\item{nCoresRV}{Number of cores used for the simulation of the
sigma variables.  By default this is 1. This uses the package
\code{\link[mvnfast]{rmvn}} and \code{\link[mvnfast]{rmvt}}.
To reproduce the results you need to run on the same platform
with the same number of cores. This is the reason this is set
to be one, regardless of what the number of cores are used in
threaded ODE solving.}

\item{sigmaIsChol}{Boolean indicating if the sigma is in the
Cholesky decomposition instead of a symmetric covariance}

\item{nDisplayProgress}{An integer indicating the minimum number
of c-based solves before a progress bar is shown.  By default
this is 10,000.}

\item{amountUnits}{This supplies the dose units of a data frame
supplied instead of an event table.  This is for importing the
data as an RxODE event table.}

\item{timeUnits}{This supplies the time units of a data frame
supplied instead of an event table.  This is for importing the
data as an RxODE event table.}

\item{stiff}{a logical (\code{TRUE} by default) indicating whether
    the ODE system is stiff or not.

    For stiff ODE sytems (\code{stiff = TRUE}), \code{RxODE} uses the
    LSODA (Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations)
    Fortran package, which implements an automatic method switching
    for stiff and non-stiff problems along the integration
    interval, authored by Hindmarsh and Petzold (2003).

    For non-stiff systems (\code{stiff = FALSE}), \code{RxODE} uses
    DOP853, an explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 8(5, 3) of
    Dormand and Prince as implemented in C by Hairer and Wanner
    (1993).}

\item{theta}{A vector of parameters that will be named THETA[#] and
added to parameters}

\item{eta}{A vector of parameters that will be named ETA[#] and
added to parameters}

\item{addDosing}{Boolean indicating if the solve should add RxODE
evid and amt columns.  This will also include dosing
information and estimates at the doses.  Be default, RxODE
only includes estimates at the observations. (default
\code{FALSE}).}

\item{updateObject}{This is an internally used flag to update the
RxODE solved object (when supplying an RxODE solved object) as
well as returning a new object.  You probably should not
modify it's \code{FALSE} default unless you are willing to
have unexpected results.}

\item{omega}{Named omega matrix.}

\item{omegaDf}{The degrees of freedom of a t-distribution for
simulation.  By default this is \code{NULL} which is
equivalent to \code{Inf} degrees, or to simulate from a normal
distribution instead of a t-distribution.}

\item{omegaIsChol}{Indicates if the \code{omega} supplied is a
Cholesky decomposed matrix instead of the traditional
symmetric matrix.}

\item{nSub}{Number between subject variabilities (ETAs) simulated for every 
realization of the parameters.}

\item{thetaMat}{Named theta matrix.}

\item{thetaDf}{The degrees of freedom of a t-distribution for
simulation.  By default this is \code{NULL} which is
equivalent to \code{Inf} degrees, or to simulate from a normal
distribution instead of a t-distribution.}

\item{thetaIsChol}{Indicates if the \code{theta} supplied is a
Cholesky decomposed matrix instead of the traditional
symmetric matrix.}

\item{nStud}{Number virtual studies to characterize uncertainty in estimated 
parameters.}

\item{dfSub}{Degrees of freedom to sample the between subject variaiblity matrix from the 
inverse Wishart distribution (scaled) or scaled inverse chi squared distribution.}

\item{dfObs}{Degrees of freedom to sample the unexplained variaiblity matrix from the 
inverse Wishart distribution (scaled) or scaled inverse chi squared distribution.}

\item{returnType}{This tells what type of object is returned.  The currently supported types are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"rxSolve"} (default) will return a reactive data frame
     that can change easily change different pieces of the solve and
     update the data frame.  This is the currently standard solving
     method in RxODE,  is used for \code{rxSolve(object, ...)}, \code{solve(object,...)},
\item \code{"data.frame"} -- returns a plain, non-reactive data
     frame; Currently very slightly Faster than \code{returnType="matrix"}
\item \code{"matrix"} -- returns a plain matrix with column names attached
    to the solved object.  This is what is used \code{object$run} as well as \code{object$solve}
}}

\item{seed}{an object specifying if and how the random number
generator should be initialized}

\item{nsim}{represents the number of simulations.  For RxODE, if
you supply single subject event tables (created with
eventTable)}

\item{a}{when using \code{solve}, this is equivalent to the
\code{object} argument.  If you specify \code{object} later in
the argument list it overwrites this parameter.}

\item{b}{when using \code{solve}, this is equivalent to the
\code{params} argument.  If you specify \code{params} as a
named argument, this overwrites the output}
}
\description{
This takes the uncertainty in the model parameter estimates and to
simulate a number of theoretical studies.  Each study simulates a
realization of the parameters from the uncertainty in the fixed
parameter estimates.  In addition the omega and sigma matrices are
simulated from the uncertainty in the Omega/Sigma matrices based
on the number of subjects and observations the model was based on.
