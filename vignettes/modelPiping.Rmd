# Changing models via piping

As in the running nlmixr vignette, Let's start with a very simple PK
example, using the single-dose theophylline dataset generously
provided by Dr. Robert A. Upton of the University of California, San
Francisco:

```{r}

library(nlmixr)

one.compartment <- function() {
    ini({
        tka <- .5   # Log Ka
        tcl <- -3.2 # Log Cl
        tv <- -1    # Log V
        eta.ka ~ 1
        eta.cl ~ 2
        eta.v ~ 1
        add.err <- 0.1
    })
    model({
        ka <- exp(tka + eta.ka)
        cl <- exp(tcl + eta.cl)
        v <- exp(tv + eta.v)
        d/dt(depot) = -ka * depot
        d/dt(center) = ka * depot - cl / v * center
        cp = center / v 
        cp ~ add(add.err)
    })
}
```

We can try the First-Order Conditional Estimation with Interaction
(FOCEi) method to find a good solution:

```{r}
fit <- nlmixr(one.compartment, theo_sd, est="focei")

fit
```

# Changing and fixing parameter values in models

Something that you may want to do is change initial estimates with a
model.  It is simple to modify the model definition and change them
yourself, but you may also want to change them in a specific way; For
example try a range of starting values to see how the system behaves
(either by full estimation or by a posthoc estimation). 
In these situations it can be come tedious to modify the models by hand.

nlmixr provides the ability to:

1. Change parameter estimates before or after running a model. (ie
   `ini(tka=0.5)`)
2. Fix parameters to arbitrary values, or estimated values (ie
   `ini(tka=fix(0.5))` or `ini(tka=fix)`)
   
The easiest way to illustrate this is by showing a few examples of
piping changes to the model:

```R
## Example 1 -- Set inital estimate to 0.5 (shown w/posthoc)
one.ka.0.5 <- fit %>%
    ini(tka=0.5) %>% 
    nlmixr(est="posthoc")

one.ka.0.5
```

```{r}
## Example 2 -- Fix tka to 0.5 and re-estimate.
one.ka.0.5 <- fit %>%
    ini(tka=fix(0.5)) %>%
    nlmixr(est="focei")

one.ka.0.5
```

```{r}
## Example 3 -- Fix tka to model estimated value and re-estimate.
one.ka.0.5 <- fit %>%
    ini(tka=fix) %>%
    nlmixr(est="focei")

one.ka.0.5
```

```{r}
## Example 4 -- Change tka to 0.7 in orginal model function and then estimate
one.ka.0.7 <- one.compartment %>%
    ini(tka=0.7) %>% 
    nlmixr(est="focei")

one.ka.0.7
```

# Changing model features

When developing models, often you add and remove between subject
variability to parameters, add covariates to the effects, and/or
change the residual errors.  You can change lines in the model by
piping the fit or the nlmixr model specification function to a `model`

## Adding or Removing between subject variability 

Often in developing a model you add and remove between subject
variability to certain model parameters.  For example, you could
remove the between subject variability in the ka parameter by changing that line in the model;  

For example to remove a eta from a prior fit or prior model
specification function, simply pipe it to the model function.  You can
then re-estimate by piping it to the `nlmixr` function again.

```{r}
## Remove eta.ka on ka
noEta <- fit %>%
    model(ka <- exp(tka)) %>%
    nlmixr(est="focei")

noEta
```

Of course you could also add an eta on a parameter in the same way;

```{r}
addBackKa <- noEta %>%
    model({ka <- exp(tka + bsv.ka)}) %>%
    ini(bsv.ka=0.1) %>%
    nlmixr(est="focei")

addBackKa
```

You can see the name change by examining the `omega` matrix:

```{r}
addBackKa$omega
```

Note that new between subject variability parameters are distinguished
from other types of parameters (ie population parameters, and
individual covariates) by their name. Parameters starting or ending
with the following names are assumed to be between subject variability
parameters:

- eta (from NONMEM convention)
- ppv (per patient variability)
- psv (per subject variability)
- iiv (inter-individual variability)
- bsv (between subject variability)
- bpv (between patient variability)


## Adding Covariate effects

```{r}
## Note currently cov is needed as a prefix so nlmixr knows this is an
## estimated parameter not a parameter
wt70 <- fit %>% ## FIXME could be based on if it finds the covarite in the last used nlmixr data.
    model({cl <- exp(tcl + eta.cl)*(WT/70)^covWtPow}) %>%
    ini(covWtPow=fix(0.75)) %>%
    nlmixr(est="focei")

wt70
```

## Changing residual errors

Changing the residual errors is also just as easy, by simply specifying the error you wish to change:

```{r}
## Since there are 0 observations in the data, these are changed to 0.0150 to show proportional error change.
d <- theo_sd
d$DV[d$EVID == 0 & d$DV == 0] <- 0.0150

addPropModel <- fit %>%
    model({cp ~ add(add.err)+prop(prop.err)}) %>%
    ini(prop.err=0.1) %>%
    nlmixr(d,est="focei")

addPropModel
```
